# Architecture

`arc` is a single-binary Cobra CLI (module `github.com/fogfish/arcnet-cli`) built per [ADR 001](adrs/001-system-architecture.md) (hexagonal/onion layering, screaming architecture) and [ADR 002](adrs/002-ux-design-system.md) (CLI UX design system). Both ADRs are Accepted and BINDING (constitution Principle I).

```

`internal/app/ctrl` is the first `internal/` package in this codebase, so ADR 001's `componentX` layout (`kernel/`, `port/`, `adapter/`, `service/`, `component.go`) now takes full effect. `internal/bios` and `internal/adapter/fsys` are deliberately shared, not use-case-private, since every future command needs an output/color/reporter kernel and every future graph-root-mounting command needs the same filesystem mount contract (research.md D3/D5 in `specs/002-arc-init/`). `internal/core` is the project's first core-domain package (ADR 001's own evolution model): the graph AST and its canonical Markdown serialization are a model invariant shared by every future graph-reading command, not an `apply`-specific concern, so they live below the use-case layer. `internal/adapter/git` is the first adapter promoted to the shared tier once a second use-case (`graph`) needed the same capability `ctrl` already had (research.md D4 in `specs/003-apply-patch/`), mirroring `internal/adapter/fsys`'s precedent.

## Command Grammar (Principle IX)

This project uses **bare top-level verbs** (`arc init`, `arc apply`, `arc list`, ...), not noun-verb nesting — permitted by ADR 002 DS-01 because the entire tool operates on exactly one kind of subject, a knowledge graph. Every subcommand follows this convention without exception.

## Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| **Graph Root** | The directory tree representing one knowledge graph instance; identified by the presence of a `.arc/` directory at its top level. Resolved and mounted via `internal/adapter/fsys` (`ResolveLocalRoot` then `Mounter.Mount`). |
| **Canonical Folder** | One of the fixed top-level directories every graph must contain: `sources/`, `entities/`, `resources/`, `timeline/yearly/`, `timeline/monthly/`, `_meta/`. Defined statically by `internal/app/ctrl/kernel.ArcNetCoreLayout`. |
| **Metadata Stub** | A registry placeholder file (`_meta/predicates.md`, `_meta/aliases.md`) that later commands append controlled-vocabulary entries to. |
| **Arc State Directory** | The `.arc/` directory holding tool-managed local state, never versioned alongside graph content (excluded via `.gitignore`). Its presence is what distinguishes an initialized Graph Root from an empty directory. |
| **Initial Commit** | The single git commit produced by `arc init` that records a graph's creation, with the mandatory subject line `graph(init): empty knowledge graph` (CORE §11.3). |
| **Patch** | A CORE §12 Markdown document — one manifest (`document`, `published`, `title`, `stats`) plus H1-kind/H2-node sections — that `arc apply` ingests into the graph. Parsed by `internal/core.ParsePatch` into `internal/core.Patch`. |
| **Node Contribution** | One H2 node section within a patch: the create-or-merge unit `arc apply` applies to the graph, one per patch-carried `internal/core.Node`. |
| **Source Node** | A node of kind `source` (CORE's fixed, always-recognized `MergeNone` kind) — the citable document a patch itself represents. |
| **Entity/Resource Node** | A node of kind `entity` (`MergeUnion`) or `resource` (`MergeUnionFirstWriter`) — CORE's fixed kinds for concepts and referenced material, mergeable across multiple contributing patches. |
| **Timeline Entry** | One chronologically-ordered bullet appended to a `timeline/yearly/<YYYY>.md` or `timeline/monthly/<YYYY-MM>.md` period file, derived from a patch's `published` manifest field (CORE §9.4, `internal/core.TimelinePeriods`/`.TimelineEntry`). |
| **Merge Behavior** | The `internal/core.MergeOp` (`none`, `union`, `union-first-writer`, `append`, `validated-overwrite`) a node's kind is registered against, determining how `internal/core.Merge` reconciles an incoming contribution with an existing node. |
| **Ingest Commit** | The single git commit `arc apply` produces per invocation, subject naming the applied document, with per-kind created/merged stats and a `Source-Id:` trailer (CORE §11.3). |
| **Kind Registration** | An entry in `.arc/config.yml`'s `mergeRules` map associating a domain-specific node kind with a `Merge Behavior`, beyond CORE's fixed kinds. An unregistered kind still applies, using the safe `union` default, with a warning (spec FR-018). |
| **Violation** | One failed CORE §14 checklist rule, produced by `arc lint`: the rule that fired, the file and line (or "not applicable"), a human-readable message, and — for violations spanning more than one file (e.g. a basename collision) — every related path. `internal/app/lint/kernel.Violation`. |
| **Lint Run** | One `arc lint` invocation: walks every node file in the graph, runs every applicable CORE §14 rule against it, and aggregates every violation found without stopping at the first one (spec FR-013). Strictly read-only — the first graph-inspecting command in this codebase that never writes to `fsys.Store` or git history. `internal/app/lint/kernel.LintResult`. |
| **Checklist Rule** | One named CORE §14 conformance check (`internal/app/lint/kernel.Rule`), e.g. unique basenames, resolvable links, source citekey identity, entity Sowa category, registered predicates, one ingest commit per document, absence of merge-conflict markers. |
| **Predicate Registry** | `_meta/predicates.md`'s parsed contents: a bullet list of inline-code-span predicate names (CORE §7.3), consumed by `arc lint` to flag unregistered or non-camelCase predicates. An absent file means every predicate is unregistered, not a lint failure of its own. |
| **Extension Profile Checklist** | `arc lint`'s CORE §10/§14 check for a non-built-in node kind: recognized (present in the resolved `core.MergeRuleSet`) vs. unrecognized, deliberately scoped to kind-recognition only — no per-kind field-schema declaration mechanism exists yet in this codebase (plan.md Complexity Tracking, `specs/004-arc-lint/research.md` D11). |
